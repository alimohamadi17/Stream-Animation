                            Dilemmas are inextricably interwoven with peopleâ€™s everyday life. Antony, in this regard, is not exceptional. The day he and Emmanuelle want to get married becomes a life-or-death situation at his workplace. So, he has to handle his marriage for which they have long planed and a business meeting in which his attendance is a must. The minister, his business partners  and all other people he talks to provide him with a particular story associated with their Lovely City. He, then, realizes why the city has been truly loved and the very fact that modernity cannot affect cultural identity.
