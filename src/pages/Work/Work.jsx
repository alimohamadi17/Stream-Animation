                            The leading characters are two siblings named Annie, 6, and Manny, 4, who are curious to explore their surroundings as all children in this age range  are. They are energetic and vigorous, yet highly capable of learning simple rules. Annie and Manny, who might be accompanied by their friends including Turtee, Hoggie and Mushi and their families, face challenging situations. For problem solving, they benefit from the suggestions or pieces of advice provided by the narrator or their parents. Teaching personal and social skills are pivotal and the topics consist of shyness, Nyctophobia, selfishness, self-confidence, and teamwork. To children, family is at the heart of their world. Thus, the emphasis is placed on the role of immediate family primarily and secondarily, the extended one.

                            Dilemmas are inextricably interwoven with people’s everyday life. Antony, in this regard, is not exceptional. The day he and Emmanuelle want to get married becomes a life-or-death situation at his workplace. So, he has to handle his marriage for which they have long planed and a business meeting in which his attendance is a must. The minister, his business partners  and all other people he talks to provide him with a particular story associated with their Lovely City. He, then, realizes why the city has been truly loved and the very fact that modernity cannot affect cultural identity.

                            Some cultural aspects of a given nation might not be accurately spotted on in the mass media. Therefore, My Dream, in the format of a five-minute short film, decided to help global audiences understand where and how aesthetically hand-made Iranian rugs would have been stemmed from. My Dream narrates the story of not just a young rural girl, but a nation as a whole whose lost belongings and memories survive in the form of so-called simple designs in a carpet, and shine for eternity. This short film has won seven international awards.

                            Thorough out history, home land has been one of the most valued entities in the world. This is a crucial matter among both human beings and other creatures. The Tree and the Bird depicts how people sacrifice and unite to fight for their freedom and home as well in a symbolic manner. In this short film ravens symbolize invaders who show no mercy even to poor, innocent women and kids. However, integrity and teamwork accompanied by collective wisdom are the key terms to rise up against mainstream brutality. This agenda has brought the film several international awards.
